# Stock Manager

Smart restocking system for a steam bun shop, built with Google ADK multi-agent architecture.

**Live Demo:** [https://stock-manager-522143897885.asia-southeast1.run.app](https://stock-manager-522143897885.asia-southeast1.run.app)

## Problem

A steam bun shop restocks by over-ordering slow-moving items and running out of fast sellers. Without data-driven insights, they waste money on excess stock and lose sales from stockouts.

## Solution

Stock Manager uses multiple AI agents to automate restocking. It analyzes sales trends, monitors stock levels, predicts potential stockouts, and generates a purchase order in Google Sheets — all from a single question.

      └── Restock Decider Agent ──→ Google Sheets (MCP)
```

## Tech Stack

| Technology | Role |
|-----------|------|
| Google ADK | Multi-agent orchestration (SequentialAgent) |
| Gemini 2.5 Flash | AI model for each agent |
| AlloyDB | Database (products, sales, inventory, suppliers) |
| Google Sheets (MCP) | Purchase order output |
| Cloud Run | Deployment (asia-southeast1) |
| FastAPI | Backend API |

## Features

1. **Sales Trend Analysis** — Identifies fast/slow movers and rising demand from AlloyDB
2. **Stock Level Monitoring** — Checks inventory against reorder points
3. **Predictive Restocking** — Recommends early restocking for trending items before stockouts
4. **Automated Purchase Order** — Creates purchase orders grouped by supplier in Google Sheets
5. **Natural Language Interface** — Ask one question, get a complete answer

## Multi-Agent Workflow

1. Shop owner asks: "What should I restock this week?"
2. **Sales Analyst** queries AlloyDB for sales trends and rising demand
3. **Inventory Checker** compares current stock against reorder points
4. **Restock Decider** combines both inputs — restocks low stock items AND items trending toward stockout
5. **Order Generator** creates a purchase order and pushes it to Google Sheets

## Dataset

Synthetic dataset for a steam bun shop with 18 products (buns, dim sum, pastries):
- 4 suppliers with lead times
- 9,852 sales transactions over 6 months
- Current inventory with mix of critical, low, and healthy stock levels
